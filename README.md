## Spring 2021 Web Development Challenge - Product Page

This is the seventh project in my [Spring 2021 - Web Development Challenge](https://10in30.alexander-morse.com/) series, where I am attempting to design, code, and ship ten different web projects in the space of one month, under a variety of constraints.

This was an attempt at a fairly "standard" marketing page, selling a pet-related service of some description.

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://arm-ac-product.surge.sh).

I had the disadvantage of being short on time for this one, needing to complete the entire project in the space of an afternoon. As a result, I probably could have given this page more polish than I ended up giving it. On the other hand, I think the final product looks a little more solid (if somewhat plainer) than my last few attempts - I was careful to design around a 12-column grid, and made slightly better choices with my markup.

I'm not entirely sure what the concept for this page is. I suppose it's selling some kind of pet-related subscription service, but I didn't have much time to think through the fictional company's hypothetical business model when I was busy trying to piece the rest of the project together.

I was going to give the 11ty static site generator a try for this project, but I ended up not having enough time to learn the basics, and I didn't want to use a starter template for my first try. Instead, I just used plain HTML and CSS. My "tool chain" is a single Node script that exists solely to minify two files and copy some stuff to the public directory. ...and honestly, that was *way* simpler to set up than anything else I've configured this month. Certainly I'd want something more robust for more complex projects, but for small things like this, I feel like I might've been overthinking my build processes.
